## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks

```javascript
// src/health.js
const express = require('express');
const db = require('./config/database');
const redis = require('./config/redis');

const app = express();

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'UP',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    uptime: process.uptime()
  };
  res.json(health);
});

app.get('/health/live', (req, res) => {
  // Kubernetes liveness probe
  res.json({ status: 'ALIVE' });
});

app.get('/health/ready', async (req, res) => {
  // Kubernetes readiness probe
  try {
    await db.query('SELECT 1');
    await redis.ping();
    res.json({ status: 'READY' });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(503).json({ status: 'NOT_READY', error: err.message });
  }
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Logging

```javascript
// src/utils/logger.js
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.json(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ 
      filename: 'logs/error.log', 
      level: 'error' 
    }),
    new winston.transports.File({ 
      filename: 'logs/combined.log' 
    })
  ]
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  logger.add(new winston.transports.Console({
    format: winston.format.simple()
  }));
}

module.exports = logger;
```

### APM Integration

```javascript
// src/apm.js
const apm = require('elastic-apm-node');

apm.start({
  serverUrl: process.env.APM_SERVER_URL,
  serviceName: 'myapp-backend',
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
});

module.exports = apm;
```
